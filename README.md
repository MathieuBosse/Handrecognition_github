# Welcome to the Handwritten Digits Recognition AI GitHub repository!

This Python program uses machine learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits. The program is built using the popular scikit-learn library and the MNIST dataset, which consists of a large number of labeled images of handwritten digits.

The program is designed to take an input image of a handwritten digit, preprocess the image to extract relevant features, and then use a trained machine learning model to predict the digit represented by the image.

The program includes both training and testing modules, allowing you to build and evaluate your own models using different algorithms and parameters.

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README file to install the required dependencies and run the program. Happy coding!
